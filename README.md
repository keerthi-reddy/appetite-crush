# FoodApp
This MEAN Stack application leverages Angular for the front-end and Express, Node.js, and MongoDB for the back-end. The app allows users to explore a variety of recipes and food articles tailored to their preferences. Users can browse through different categories, filter based on specific ingredients, and discover personalized content, making it a comprehensive platform for food enthusiasts.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
